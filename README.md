# Computer Vision Projects

This repo contains some of my personal computer vision projects that I built while learning OpenCV and AI.

## Projects

### Click_using_hand.py
A simple program that lets you control the mouse using hand gestures. I used OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect the hand and track its position.

### Emotion_recognition.py
This script detects faces in a video feed and tries to recognize emotions using a trained model. I used OpenCV and a basic deep learning model.

### iphone_connection.py
A small script that connects to my iPhone camera feed using DroidCam and OpenCV. It captures the video and shows it in a window so I can test computer vision tasks on it.

## Tools used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Some deep learning models (for emotion recognition)

*These projects helped me practice real-time computer vision and basic AI tasks. More projects will be added soon!*
